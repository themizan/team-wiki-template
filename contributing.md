## Here is how to contribute to the wiki

- Documentation should __NOT__ include usernames or passwords.
- Do not rely soley on images for documentation. It's ok for an initial quick and dirty attempt, but images are not searchable.
- Keep it professional.
- If you have a question, search the wiki. If the answer isn't there, ask a colleague or figure it out. Once you're done, make sure to add it to the wiki!
