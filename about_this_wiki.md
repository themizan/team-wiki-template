## What is this all about?

Perhaps you've just started a totally new department. Perhaps you've taken over an existing, poorly functioning team. You (hopefully) know you need to document your in a consistent and accessible manner, and keep it up to date. Where to start? This wiki aims to give you a framework.

This is not meant to be the end all be all to documentation. It is simply a method I have found to work for me after adopting numerous teams with zero documentation. This system has worked to take teams from 0 documentation to having a fully detailed operations manual. They have done this while coping of the stresses of day to day operations duties. If they can, you can too.

## Where to start reading

First and foremost, you'll want to read the "Setting up your environment" HowTo to make sure everything is setup properly.
 
Next, you'll probably want to read the Systems pages to gain familarity with the systems, their user bases, technology, etc.

The HowTos area will come in handy when assigned a task you are not familiar with, but need not be memorized.

## Where to start documenting

First import any existing relevant paper documentation, if available.

If you're like many departments, you will likely be starting off with little to no documentation. Start documenting the following:

- immediately
  - day to day procedures
  - project proposals
  - postmortems
- as performed
	- less common procedures
- as time allows
	- system overviews
	- infrastructure configuration (priority)
	- code styles	
- if necessary
	- how to contribute
- at new hire
  - developer environment setup (automate asap)
   
Documentation should be written at a level that a new hire to the department could fully follow. The best way to facilitate this is to have the most junior member ask the most senior how to accomplish the task. The junior member should perform the ask and document the procedure in his/her own words.

Encourage members to always check the wiki. Only after that should they ask another team member. Make sure the answer gets documented.

Documentation needs to constantly be updated. If a procedure is wrong, take a minute to update the docs. When building a new project don't forget to document it! Often times, a well written project proposal can act as a skeleton for this.
